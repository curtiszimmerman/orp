The following points clarify the QEMU license for the mselSoC ORP

1) QEMU as a whole is released under the GNU General Public License,
version 2.

2) Parts of QEMU have specific licenses which are compatible with the
GNU General Public License, version 2. Hence each source file contains
its own licensing information.  Source files with no licensing information
are released under the GNU General Public License, version 2 or (at your
option) any later version.

As of July 2013, contributions under version 2 of the GNU General Public
License (and no later version) are only accepted for the following files
or directories: bsd-user/, linux-user/, hw/misc/vfio.c, hw/xen/xen_pt*.

3) The Tiny Code Generator (TCG) is released under the BSD license
   (see license headers in files).

4) QEMU is a trademark of Fabrice Bellard.

5) The additional components of QEMU that emulate the mselSoC ORP have
are licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  These files are 
contained in hw/openrisc, include/hw/openrisc, and target-openrisc.
New files to QEMU contain the Apache licensing information; files
that have been modified to support the mselSoC have an accompanying
diff file that show the added changes which support the mselSoC ORP.

6) All changes that support the mselSoC ORP are Copyright 2015, 
Google, Inc.
